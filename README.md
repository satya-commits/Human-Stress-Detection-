# Human-Stress-Detection-
Human stress has become a significant focus of research due to its profound impact on health and productivity. Accurate stress detection is critical for early intervention and effective management. This study explores various machine learning and deep learning classifiers for human stress detection. Multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost Random Forest, Adaboost SVM, XGBoost, Ensemble Learning, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN), were evaluated on a labeled stress dataset. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, F1 Score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce feature dimensions and improve computational efficiency. The combination of PCA with classifiers was analyzed to determine its impact on performance. An ensemble approach was also employed, where the Naïve Bayes model served as the base, and SVM and Random Forest served as member models. The results demonstrate the efficacy of feature reduction techniques and ensemble models in improving classification performance.
This research offers a comprehensive evaluation of classifiers for human stress detection, emphasizing the potential of machine learning to address critical challenges in healthcare and well-being.
